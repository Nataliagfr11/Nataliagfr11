## 👋 Hi, I’m Natalia Gérard 

<!--
**Nataliagfr11/Nataliagfr11** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a Master’s student (M2) in **Data and Artificial Intelligence** at ESILV, pursuing a dual engineering and management degree with EMLV.  
My studies are strongly oriented towards **data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence**, with practical experience gained through academic and personal projects.  

Alongside this technical foundation, I have also explored **UX Design**, allowing me to enrich my projects with user-centric perspectives and creative approaches.  
Driven by curiosity and adaptability, I am eager to apply my skills to impactful real-world challenges.
